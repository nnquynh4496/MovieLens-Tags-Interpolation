This Github repository contains Movielens datasets 100K and 1M variations that we have experimented in a submitted paper titled "Genres and Actors/Actresses as Interpolated Tags for Improving Movie Recommender Systems". The paper is currently submitted to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA) and under review. The datasets will be available as the paper gets published. Thank you.
